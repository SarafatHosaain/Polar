		<center><b><h3><ins>STP Strategies</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>STP showcasing is a three-venture way to deal with building a focused on promoting plan. The "S" represents Segmenting, the "T" for Targeting, and the "P" for Positioning.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<center><b><h3><ins>Segmenting:</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>Market Segmenting is a marketing concept that refers to grouping prospective buyers into groups or segments with similar needs and responding to marketing actions in a similar way. Market segmentation helps businesses to reach various types of customers that value goods and services differently. Market segmentation aims to reduce risk by determining which products have the best chances of gaining a share of a target market and choosing the best way to deliver the products to the market. This enables the company to improve its overall efficiency by directing limited resources toward efforts that yield the highest return on investment.<br> 
<br>The Polar Ice Cream Company can segment its business into three distinct types of segments.
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Demographic Segmentation</li>
			<li>Psychographic Segmentation</li>
			<li>Behavioral Segmentation</li>
		</ol>
</p><br>
		<center><b><h3><ins>Demographic Segmentation:</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>
			Demographic segmentation is categorizing a market based on variables such as age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, religion, race, and nationality. As one might expect, demographic segmentation variables are among the most popular bases for segmenting customer groups. The reason behind the fact that customer desires are closely related to variables such as income and age.<br>
<br>We can segment the Polar Ice Cream market by age, family size, generation, income and social class.</p>

			<center><b><h3><ins>Psychographic Segmentation:</ins></h3></b></center>
			<p>Psychographic segmentation helps the company to comprehend the consumers better. The same demographic group such as age, personality, income, occupation, social status can have distinct Psychographic profiles. The Polar Ice Cream company can use psychographic segmentation to categorize markets based on lifestyle and personality traits.</p>
			<br>


			<center><b><h3><ins>Behavioral Segmentation:</ins></h3></b></center>
			<p>Behavioral segmentation is consumers classified into groups based on their product knowledge, attitude toward use, or reaction to a product.<br>
<br>Consumers can buy ice cream occasionally; sometimes, they buy ice cream from past experiences. This depends on user status and loyalty status.
</p>	
		<br>

		<center><b><h3><ins>Targeting</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>When an organization has different, undeniable market partitions, they routinely need to change promoting endeavors that appeal to each. Going through the STP cycle, the association picks what segment to zero in on for the looming activity. Focus on is evaluating the various areas. The polar frozen yogurt organization ought to figure out which and the number of units it will target. On a fundamental level, the association zeroed in on the kids, young age, and middle age, yet being frozen yogurt, here and their people from various sorts used to have frozen yogurt. They zeroed in on the understudies. In 2015 they introduced a stick lolly frozen yogurt called tamarind lolly, basically for the ladies and woman. They, in like manner, focus on the lower common laborers, regular workers, and lower working people.</p>
		<br>

		<center><b><h3><ins>Positioning</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>Positioning is the way an organization adjusts its image or items in the objective market. The objective is to offer something more critical, better, or more important than your rivals to a specific market fragment.<br>
<br>Polar ice-cream makes a tremendous motivating force for frozen yogurt. They pick incredible arranging to attract the clients since they will be burned-through in the purchaser's cerebrum. They set their thing to the frozen yogurt darlings who need different tastes and a variety of flavors. They need to convey a smile to the customer's face by giving the best quality frozen yogurt. Bangladesh is a tropical country, so people, for the most part, maneuver into frozen yogurt for the climate. They fulfilled the customer's need by their best arranging.
</p>
		<br>

		<center><b><h3><ins>MARKETING MIX</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>
		The marketing mix strategies which are called 4P’s of marketing, fall under one of the major concepts of marketing and can be demonstrated by 4P’s. These 4P’s are: Product, Price, Place and Promotion.</p>
		<br>

		<center><b><h3><ins>PRODUCT</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>Anything that is offered to the market to satisfy customers need, is called product. The three levels of a product are: Core product, Actual product and Augmented product. Core Product is mainly fulfilling the basic customer need. Actual Product refers to the tangible, physical product; specifically, the features, design and quality of a product.  Augmented Product, the non-physical parts of the product, basically denotes after sale services.</p>
		<br>

		<b><h3>Product level of Polar ice cream:</h3></b>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Core product:</b>The core product of the Polar is its branded ice creams "POLAR".<br>

		<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Actual product:</b><br>
		<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Brand name:</b>POLAR.<br>

		<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Features:</b><br>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>Ice Cream with different taste and flavors</li>
			<li>Usages of proper extent of all ingredients</li>
			<li>Using Australian raw materials in production</li>
			<li>Applying European technology in packaging and distribution</li>
		</ul>

		<b>Design or flavors:</b> Vanilla, Strawberry, Fruity, Doi, Kheer, Pista, Chocolate, Malai, Cake.<br>

		<br><b>Augmented Product:</b>: Polar Provides conveyance of their items with their van and encourages their clients with installment facility.
With the assistance of combining three levels of a product, an organization can present a superior result on the lookout and comprehend the need of their clients.<br>
		
		<br><b><h3>Branding Strategy of Polar Ice Cream:</h3></b>
		<p>Branding strategy is needed for launching a product and building a strong position for that product in the market. The four branding strategies are: Line extention, Brand extenion, Multibrands, New brands.</p>
		<p>After analyzing all the strategies, we've indentified that Line extention perfectly goes with Polar. Line extention is when an organaization extends its current product line of an existing brand by adding some new features to the existing products, but does not launch completely new product. Polar ice cream cream is the brand of ice cream and deals with only one brand ‘Polar’. According to the line extension strategy, Polar frequently adds some new flavors of ice cream in its production line to compete with the other rivals in the market. That’s why, the branding strategy of Polar Ice Cream is Line extension.  </p>

		<center><b><h3><ins>Price</ins></h3></b></center>
		<b>Pricing policy of polar ice cream:</b>
		<p>The three major pricing strategies are: Customer value based pricing, cost based pricing, Competitor based pricing. From these three strategies, Customer value based pricing matches with Polar. Customer value based pricing means setting the price according to the consumer’s perceptions of value. In customer value based pricing, Good value pricing policy absolutely indicates Polar’s pricing method. Good value pricing is offering the right combination of quality as well as good service at a fair price. Accordingly, to maintain customer satisfaction, Dhaka Ice Cream Industries Limited has decided to produce Polar ice cream with proper hygiene and make it affordable to the consumers. So, owing to providing quality product at a reasonable price and setting price in accordance with customer’s perceived value, the pricing policy of Polar Ice Cream can be considered as Customer value based pricing. </p>

		<br>
		<b><h3>The possible internal and external factors which might affect the pricing decision of Polar Ice Cream:</h3></b>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Internal Factors:</b>Some possible internal factors, such as costs, organizational factors, different characteristics can affect the pricing decision. Organizational factors work on setting the price. In this regard, the production team, the marketing team and the top executives can finalize the price. Even Dhaka Ice Cream Industries Limited has the ability to set the price. The cost should be set initially on the basis of customer’s ability. Afterwards, it’ll be increasing based on the product’s demand and quality. Besides, the different characteristics of the product like taste, flavors, packaging etc can also influence the price. <br>
		<br>
		<b>External factors:</b>The market demand, Competitors, Suppliers, Customers can be the possible external factors which will influence the Polar’s pricing decision. If the market demand of Polar ice cream is higher, the price will be higher. Otherwise, the price will be lower. Even If no Competitors can provide premium quality, the price can be increased. Also when the company gains more profit, suppliers can charge more price. Moreover, the perspectives and preferences of customers have an impact on Polar's pricing decision as well.This is how some internal and external factors can influence the pricing decision of Polar Ice Cream.<br>
		<br>     
		<center><b><h3><ins>Placement/ Distribution Channel</ins></h3></b></center>
		<p>Distribution channel or the placement of products of any company refers to the set of interdependent companies involved in making a product or service available. Generally, having a distribution system for the effects of a company is necessary to reach potential customers and to be able to keep a competitive advantage.</p>
		<p>There is different sort of distribution channels to follow, but for polar ice cream, the best possible channel level would be channel level 3; this is an Indirect channel system where the manufacturers send the product to the present wholesalers from them to retailers finally to the consumers.</p>
		<p>Ice creams are more considered perishable good or product as it cannot be kept unattained and needs to be taken good care of by using a freezer. To consumers, ice creams are the sort of products that can be readily available, for example, finding them in the nearest shop of their house or even easily purchasable online.</p>
		<p>Polar is a large company with an all-in mentality and a good amount of financial backing. Thus, considering the reasons mentioned above and aspects, the polar company should utilize “channel level 3,” where the product goes from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailers and finally reaches the consumer. It is to be ensured that the intensive number of marketing intermediaries are present, which means having so many intermediaries in the channel that the products can be stocked in abundance in as many outlets as possible. This will help in reaching the customers faster and in a vast way.</p>
		<p>Now comes the question of conventional or vertical marketing systems. No company can solely achieve the perfect marketing system by following any one method in particular. The contractual vertical marketing system could have a firm grasp over the market and sales and conventional marketing channels. A traditional channel of marketing is cheaper and is more feasible to apply and maintain. VMS system will be much more expensive yet will be organized. Utilizing that staying organized aspect using contractual VMS will help polarize some independent firms or shops at crucial points that might be missed with the conventional marketing channel system.</p>
		<center><b><h3><ins>Promotion</ins></h3></b></center>
		<b>Identifying the Target Audience:</b>Ice cream is a popular dessert which appeals to all customer groups, regardless of their ages, races, genders or locations. As a result, polar does not target a particular consumer group rather they consider the whole consumer group as one and market their product under ‘Undifferentiated marketing method’.
 Undifferentiated marketing is when a company tries to capture all kinds of consumer groups by just creating one message. And as Polar’s products are appealing to all kinds of customer base undifferentiated marketing is the best method for them to market their product.  <br>

 		<br>
 		<b><ins>Communicable Objective:</ins></b>Communication helps an organization to reach its desired goals. Polar ice cream satisfies the minds of customers and brings a smile to their faces. In this way polar ice cream spreads joy among the customers and move towards their goal. This increases the customer's engagement with Polar and creates a friendly environment between the customer and the seller. It paints a positive picture of the organization and boosts company’s goodwill.<br>
 		<br>
 		<b><ins>Desinging the promotion message:</ins></b>Every company tries to catch the customer’s eyes and attraction. As a result, they use different kinds of promotional message that might look attractive to the customer and can catch the customers’ value. A company should figure out what kind of message will be the most appealing for the customers of their product and design their message accordingly. In the case of polar ice cream, they often send out messages containing offers and discounts like Buy one get one free and 20-30% discount. This attracts both their existing and potential customers.<br>
 		<br>
 		<b><ins>Choosing the appropiate media:</ins></b>In todays’ world, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other social medias’ are as much or even more so important than traditional TV, newspaper media. Especially in the time of COVID-19 the importance of online media has grown exponentially since it is not possible to physically promote. Polar has also followed suit with the times and now focusing mainly on promoting their products throw social media’s like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.<br>
 		<br>
 		<b><ins>Budgeting method for promotion:</ins></b>When Polar Ice Cream prepared their first budget, they had a pretty good idea of keeping their budget in balance. They usually formulate it after thinking for 6 months or a year. They can assume very well that in which month their budget situation might not be good and in which month they will be able to earn more. They take advantage of every possible opportunity to consider their rise or fall. They always keep in mind when raising their budget to how much money any product will be able to raise. They estimate the cost of implementing the long-term plan. They make logical decisions about annual income expenditures and invest with long-term financial goals in min.<br>
 		<br>
 		<b><ins>Promotion Mix Strategies:</ins></b><br>
 		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b><ins>Advertising:</ins></b>Polar ice cream usually promotes itself through popular media such as television, various popular magazines, Facebook, Instagram. Their advertising is very attractive which attracts the customer to their product. They also promote themselves through various banners and billboards and sponsor various sports or social events.<br>

		 <p>During a product’s life, it moves throw different stages of a products life cycle. It is the company’s duty to figure out at which stage of product life cycle their product belongs to and take future decisions accordingly. In the case of polar ice cream, we think they are on “Maturity stage”. Their sales have grown in the previous years but currently at a stagnant place. </p>
		 <p>During a product’s life, it moves throw different stages of a products life cycle. It is the company’s duty to figure out at which stage of product life cycle their product belongs to and take future decisions accordingly. In the case of polar ice cream, we think they are on “Maturity stage”. Their sales have grown in the previous years but currently at a stagnant place. </p>
		 <p>Discussing about the future strategies that polar should follow, we think that polar should mostly focus on the fundamental of maturity stage, which is to increase the benefits while defending market share or on other instance developing the product. Which in polar ice cream’s view would be to increase the number of flavor’s and types of ice cream. And by following this, polar can catch a bigger amount of customer’s value. Other thing polar should focus on is developing their distribution channel. Because it is true that although people know about the brand they often cannot purchase their product due to the lack of availability. We believe that if polar ice cream focuses on these strategies they can improve their business strategy and can compete even closely with their competitors. </p>
